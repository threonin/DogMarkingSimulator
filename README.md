DogMarkingSimulator
===================

Small example game I developed for teaching Game Programming at HTL Pinkfeld.

It really is just a small demonstration to teach pupils how to use JMonkeyEngine, so there is hardly anything there, hardest part was creating the crappy dog model with blender.

You can use arrow keys to move, space to jump and right shift to mark. Tab toggles the dog skins.
All marked spots will be connected and so the area of the dog expanded as long as the new puddle is not in the area of another dog.
Overlapping areas are not tested and there is no real objective in the game, as it's just a weird little demo.
There is an army of rival dogs who randomly walk around and mark so the whole level will be covered with lines very soon.
